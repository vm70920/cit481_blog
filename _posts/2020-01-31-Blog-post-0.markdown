<h3>What is Kubernetes?</h3>

Kubernetes is an open source platform that automates Linux container operations. It eliminates many of the manual processes involved in deploying and scaling containerized applications. In other words, users cluster together groups of hosts running Linux containers, and Kubernetes helps you easily and efficiently manage those clusters. Kubernetes clusters can span hosts across public, private, or hybrid clouds. For this reason, Kubernetes is an ideal platform for hosting cloud-native applications that require rapid scaling.

<h3>Why to use Kubernetes?</h3>

Some applications operates on multiple containers that deployed across multiple server hosts and required multilayered security for containers. Kubernetes provides tools for orchestration and management of capabilities required to deploy containers to achieve desired functionality. Kubernetes allows to build applications that involve multiple containers, schedule activities for containers across a cluster, scale containers, and monitor health of containers. As well Kubernetes integrates with networking, storage, security, and many other services to provide a comprehensive container infrastructure.
