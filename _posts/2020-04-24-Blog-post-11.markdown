<h3>Puppet</h3>

Puppet is a systems management tool for centralizing and automating the configuration management process. Puppet software allows to configure, manage, deploy, and orchestrate applications and services at specified infrastructure. Puppet was designed to manage the configuration of Linux and Windows OSs. Puppet written in Ruby and uses Domain Specific Language (DSL) to describe system configuration.

There are two versions of Puppet:

  - Open Source Puppet - a basic version, also known as Open Source Puppet, available at Puppet's website and licensed under the Apache 2.0

  - Puppet Enterprise - commercial version with features like compliance reporting, orchestration, role-based access control, GUI, API and command line tools to manage nodes

Puppet functionality:

  - define distinct configurations for every host
  - continuously monitor servers to confirm that desired configuration exists or not, and is not altered. In case if configuration was changed, Puppet will revert configuration to pre-existing conditions
  - provides centralized control over configured system, thus applied changes gets automatically effected
  - automatically deploys software to configured systems, and implements infrastructure as a code

Puppet uses declarative programming approach: expressing logic of computation (what to do) and  omitting description of control flow (how to do it). For instance, following picture depicts declarative programming approach in creation of user (using Puppet domain specific language).

Puppet is using pull deployment model, when agent nodes every 1800 seconds calls master node to see if there are updates and anything needs to be updated. If new update present then agent pulls puppet code from the master and performs required actions. In Puppet, the master is a Linux based machine with master software installed on it, and responsible for maintaining configs specified in puppet codes. The Puppet master node can be only Linux. Puppet agents are target machines managed by agent with installed agent software. Puppet agent can be configured as supported operating system: Linux, Windows, Solaris, or Mac OS. The communication between master and agent is established through secure certificates.
