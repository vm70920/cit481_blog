<h3>AWS RDS</h3>

AWS RDS (relational database service) allows to set up and operate relational database in cloud. Service allows to automate time consuming administrative and maintenance tasks (hardware provisioning, database setup, updates, patches, and backups). Also, provides resizable capacity for emerging needs. AWS RDS provides most common database engines to choose: Amazon Aurora, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle Databse, and SQL Serbver. To fulfill any needs of users, AWS offers service to migrate or replicate existing databases to Amazon RDS, called AWS Database Migration Service.

To create database instance:

    aws rds create-db-instance \
   		 --allocated-storage 35 --db-instance-class db.m1.small \
   		 --db-instance-identifier db_instance_name \
   		 --engine mysql \
   		 --enable-cloudwatch-logs-exports '["audit","error","general","slowquery"]' \
   		 --master-username master \
   		 --master-user-password master_password

Create database security group to control access to database instance.

    aws rds create-db-security-group \
		    --db-security-group-name db_sgroup \
		    --db-security-group-description "Database Security Group"

To stop AWS RDS instance:

    aws rds stop-db-instance --db-instance-identifier db_instance_name


To start AWS RDS instance (the one that was previously stopped by command stop-db-instance):

aws rds start-db-instance --db-instance-identifier db_instance_name

To reboot database instance, for example if database modifications were made, or group parameters were changed:

		aws rds reboot-db-instance --db-instance-identifier db_instance_name


In case if one or more database configuration parameters need to be modified, use:

		aws rds modify-db-instance \
    			--db-instance-identifier db_instance_name \
    			--db-instance-class db.m1.large \
    			--apply-immediately
